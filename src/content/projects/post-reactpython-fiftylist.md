#### Key Features:

##### Frontend (React.js)
- Spotify Integration: Fetches your top 50 tracks from Spotify within a chosen timeframe (1, 6 months, or all-time classics).
- Export To Playlist (Results): Automatically generates a new playlist on your Spotify account with these 50 tracks.
- Export To Playlist (Recommendations): Based on your top 50 listened songs, our recommendation engine suggests an additional 20 songs to add to your playlists.

##### Backend (Python)
- Flask-Powered: Acts as a middleware that interfaces with React.
- Fifty Card: Organizes retrieved tracks dynamically into a static brand new website in order to provide sharing functionality to social media or for accessing later, including artist names, song titles, album names, release dates, and genres.

#### About the Project
FiftyList is an exploratory project diving deep into the collaboration of different programming languages and APIs. It is designed to:
- Demonstrate Seamless Communication: Showcases smooth communication between the frontend and backend using API calls.
- Emphasize Language Synergy: Highlights the synergy between React's frontend prowess and Python's backend efficiency.
- Data Presentation Challenge: Ensures that complex data is rendered in a user-friendly format and transmitted effectively between systems.

#### Installation and Usage:

##### For Frontend Installation:
1. Clone this project.
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-react-v2.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory (in your terminal IDE).
```bash
cd /your/folder/directory/fiftylist-react-v2
```
3. Run the following command to install all required dependecies.
```bash
npm install
```
4. Replace the environment variables (`REACT_APP_SCOPES`, `REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI`, `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`) with your own. You can generate these variables from Spotify Developer Dashboard.
5. Replace the variable defined at the beginning of the code in `App.js`:
   `const redirectUri = 'https://fiftylist.vercel.app/callback';` with -> `const redirectUri = "http://localhost:3000/callback";`
   Update the URLs in the variables of the `exportShare` function from `'https://fiftylistbackend.vercel.app/share'` to `'http://localhost:5000/share'` if your Python backend is using a different 
   port.
6. Run the following command from your terminal IDE; this should start the frontend on the designated port. 
```bash
npm start
```

##### For Backend Installation:
##### Prerequisites:
[**Python 3.11**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

1. Clone the project. ( https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-python-v2 )
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-python-v2.git
```

1.2 Navigate to the project directory (in your terminal IDE).
```bash
cd /your/folder/directory/fiftylist-python-v2
```
2. Run the following command to install all required dependecies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Replace the variable defined at the beginning of the share.py code: `cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/share": {"origins": "https://fiftylist-frontend.vercel.app/"}})` with ->  `cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/share": {"origins": "http://localhost:3000/"}})` (or the port you designated for your frontend).
4. Run `python3 share.py`.
   
IMPORTANT: Open two separate windows in your IDE to run the fullstack locally. Execute the commands to have both projects running simultaneously for them to work seamlessly.
