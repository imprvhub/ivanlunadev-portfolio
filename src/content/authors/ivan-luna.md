I specialize in driving **innovation, integrity, and teamwork culture** in every project I participate in, generating **high-impact and value-added solutions**. I began with **Python** in October 2020. Throughout my experience, I have worked on **integrating backends** in Python with **AI and frontend solutions**. I have knowledge in frontend development using technologies such as **Vanilla JS, React.js, Astro.js, Vue.js, and Node.js**, as well as experience with cloud platforms like **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.
