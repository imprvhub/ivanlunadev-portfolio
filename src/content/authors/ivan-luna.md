Based in Buenos Aires, I am a **Backend developer** with a technical focus on **Python** (four years of experience), I have also worked with technologies such as Vanilla Javascript, Vue.js, React.js, Vite.js, Nuxt.js and Node.js. My programming career began as a complementary interest during my Psychology studies, evolving into a central role in my life. Currently, I am dedicated to mastering new frameworks and exploring advanced concepts in machine learning and data science. Actively seeking job opportunities, my commitment to innovation and dedication positions me as a results-oriented professional.
