Based in Buenos Aires, I’ve been working with **Python** since October 2020, when I started learning to program. I also have experience in frontend development using **Vanilla JS, React.js, Astro.js, Vue.js,** and **Node.js**, integrating them with Python backends and AI. I’ve worked with cloud services like **AWS, Azure,** and **GCP**. I’m dedicated to **learning** and always give my best, with **commitment and high standards**. I’m looking to join a team where I can continue to grow and contribute.
