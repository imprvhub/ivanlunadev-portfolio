Based in Buenos Aires, I specialize in **backend** and **fullstack development**, with a technical focus on **Python** since October 2020, when I began learning to program. My experience in frontend development includes working with **Vanilla JS, React.js, Node.js, and more**. Always integrating these technologies into Python-based backend solutions. Additionally, my projects have involved approaches utilizing cloud platforms like **AWS, GCP, and Azure**. 
Eager to transition into my first professional role in development, I'm ready to contribute to innovative projects and leverage my expertise!
