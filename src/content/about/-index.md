Based in Buenos Aires. I am a **Backend developer** with a technical focus on **Python** since October, 2020. My programming career began as a complementary interest during my Psychology studies, evolving into a central role in my life. I have gained valuable experience working with various **cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP and even Azure**. I have also worked with technologies such as **Vanilla JS, React.js, Node.js, and more**. Currently, I am dedicated to mastering new frameworks and exploring advanced concepts of **Cloud environments and AI**. My commitment to innovation and dedication positions me as a results-oriented professional.
