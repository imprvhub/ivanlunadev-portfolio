## Identified Issues & Pending Tasks
This section presents a summary of known issues and bugs, along with pending tasks.

**Identified Issues**

- From mobile dimensions, if the user expands the 'nav-menu' and then resizes the screen to more than 1024px width, the nav-menu breaks. While this behavior may not be common, it's important to maintain consistency in responsive interactions for all user interactions.


**Pending Tasks**

- Fix the responsive behavior of the nav-menu when transitioning from mobile to desktop using an intersection observer.
